# Pencil-Durability-Kata
A code kata to help improve TDD techniques


To use app:
1. Clone repository locally
```git clone git@github.com:Zakkski/Pencil-Durability-Kata.git```
2. Enter file location
3. Run ```ruby app.rb``` to run the application

You will be presented with a number of options that control what you can do with the pencil (write, erase, edit, sharpen). You can change the different qualities of the pencil in the app.rb file.

*Durability*: how many characters the pencil can write (this will also be the number that is returned to when the pencil is sharpened)
*Eraser*: how many characters the pencil can erase
*Length*: how many times the pencil can be sharpened before it can no longer write
